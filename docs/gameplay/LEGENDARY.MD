# Legendary ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The goal of this paper is to details what legendary avatars are, how they are minted and what perks do they currently offer and what is planned for them in the future.

# What are legendary avatars ?

Our avatar minter allow for a fully customizable avatar, we are aiming at improving the minter at every season with more artworks and more options for everyone.

Avatar created trough the minter are considered **normal** avatars. Each avatar minted correspond to one season. We are currently at **season 0**.

# How to get one ?

Legendary avatars are generally obtained during events (as prices) and for special contributors of the Squad. They cannot be paid for as they aim to become a proof of intense involvement within the Internet Computer ecosystem.

Currently the process to create a legendary avatar and mint it is entirely in the hand of the **team** but we aim to provide more transparency on it and soon the possibility for the community to elect a **monthly contributor** that will receive his legendary avatar.

# Can they be sold ?

In theory, they cannot be sold, we don't plan to allow this possibility as it would conflict with the principle that they cannot be paid for.

In reality, nothing prevent a legendary owner to transfer his avatar to someone in exchange for some money.

# What are the advantages of owning a legendary avatar ?

Owning a legendary avatar will provide **lifelong** advantages.

- Access to monthly meeting of the Squad.
- Access to the **Legendary** portal on DSCVR that will regroup many OG member of the community, influencial founders and figures of the community.
- Owning a legendary avatar will always provide the maximum **season** boost. (Read here for more infos)
- Voting power to influence the direction of the DAO.
- Ability to create missions and manage them.
- Access to events and iniatitives organized by the Squad.

# Improvements ‚úÖ

Currently legendary avatars cannot equip accessories; need to resolve this issue as soon as possible as it introduces a discrepancy between the two types of avatar.
