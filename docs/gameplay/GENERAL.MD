# ICP Squad

## What is ICP Squad ?

The ICP Squad is a community that has been established since the **Genesis** of the **Internet Computer** in order to support the grand vision of reinventing the Internet.

ICP Squad is also the name of one of the most inclusive and ambitious NFT project that aims to become the framework on which the community can evolve and structure.

## The mission üéØ

The community has grandiose aspirations, at it aims at nothing less than become the most influencial crypto community in the world.

**Let's help the Internet Computer make a huge difference in the world**.

## The iniatives üåà

In order to achieve this vision we need to create and support many concrete initiatives, namely :

- **Community building**.

  This is probably the most important aspect of all. <br/>
  We believe the most valuable asset in the revolution to come is the **community** you can build around you. <br/> That is why we will encourage people to connect with like-minded members of the squad, organize conference, community calls and any event that can connect people in a meaningul way. <br/>
  Building a successfull community is not about the number of people you can get to follow you, but how deep you can connect with them. <br/>

- **Education**.

  Knowledge is a necessary tool to gather in this century; especially with all the technical revolutions that are coming, the Internet Computer being one of them. <br/> Knowledge is a special asset as it can be **shared** and contrary to most other assets; the more you share it the more it grows. We aim to evolve as a community and learn along the way.  
  Education is also an essential aspect of building a successful community at it brings people together in a meaningful way.<br/>

- **Media and marketing**.
  <br/> Our ambitions can only be realized if we have a strong **visibility** and **\*influence** and a voice that can be heard globally.
  We will engage across multiple social platforms (inside and outside of the IC ecosystem) and websites to relentlessly pursue crypto community hegemony. <br/> We also want to help and promote any project that is part of our vision.

- **Investement**.

  Making an impact in the worl means having capitals and using them accordingly to finance innovations and builders around the world. <br/> We aims to create a commmunity-driven DAO designed to provide funds to promising projects building on the Internet Computer.

- **Transparency and decentralization**

  Building and organizing a huge community in a **transparent** manner will require a lot of work. <br/> We strongly believe in a future where power and responsability are actually in the hands of peoples. <br/> Leaders will still be necesary and we are looking for people that can lead in our community but leaders also need to understand that being a leader of the community will also comes with responsability around your actions and decisions. <br/>

  To achieve our objectives, we will start by writting a **constitution** that will contains the core values of ICP Squad. Building on this constitution we will regularly assess our own progress towards being a fully decentralized and transparent DAO.
