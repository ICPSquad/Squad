# Score and leaderboad

## Style üòé

Calculated by the stars of the [accessory](ACCESSORY.MD) your wear.

Each accessory has a number of star associated with it, each day you collect the number of stars corrresponding to the accessories that you are wearing.
At the end of each month, the leaderboard is reset and the stars you've collected for this month are added into your account for future usage.

The style score will range between 0 and 750.

A style score of 0 indicates an avatar that had 0 accessory on it during the month.

A style score of 500 indicates an avatar that was fully equipped during the whole month with 5 stars accessories. <br/>

Here's the formula to calculate the **style score**.

The **style** score aims to be a rough approximation of **how much money** the player has invested into the game.

## Engagement üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Calculated through **missions** and **engagement** points with our partners.

- [Missions](MISSION.MD) : a list of tasks they can perform to increase their score. <br/>

- [Engage-to-earn](ENGAGE-TO-EARN.MD) : a list of scores that are automatically querried from our partners dapps taking into account the eventual bonus given out by the **branded** accessories.

The engagement score will range from 0 to unbounded and will take into account both the **mission score** and the **engage-to-earn score**.

‚ö†Ô∏è One of the main issue with the engage-to-earn score is that the precision and value of this score **greatly** depends on the number of dapps we have integrated with and also how precise the metrics they have on their own users are. <br/>
The end-goal is to have a really precise system that allow us to calculate a precise **engagement score** accross many dapps on the Internet Computer but this is an endeavour that will likely take years and many trials; this also liklely needs to be something that is integrated into an Open Internet Service where everyone can make use of it. <br/>
This concept alone would require a decitated team working on it full time; we don't have the ressources to do so for the moment so we will start with an easy enough concept and a limited number of dapps. <br/>
Meanwhile we will stay active in the community and keep an eye open on the work that will be done by other dapps into this area.

The **engagement** score aims to be a rough approximation of **how much time** the player has invested into the game.
