## Avatar ðŸ‘¦

The goal of this paper is to defined what is an ICPSquad avatar, how you can mint one, how you can improve your avatar and what is planned in the future.

# What is an ICPSquad avatar ?

An ICPSquad avatar is an fully on-chain NFT. <br/> It aims to be a fully living character that represents you, the value and projects you support and the achievements you unlocked.

# How can I get one ?

The minting process is open with unlimited access (for the moment); you can play around with our avatar minter and fully customize your NFT before minting. <br/>
The minting fee is 1 ICP. <br/>

Being part of the Squad give you access to special airdrops, acess to missions and opportunities within the ecosystem.

# Improvements

Just a bunch of ideas (for next season) ðŸš€

- Emotions : Allow avatars to have different emotions and people have a menu where they can modify the emotion.

- Name : People can give names to their avatars when they mint it. After that changing name will cost a fee.

- Level : Have different levels of avatars (1/2/3/Legendary). <br/> All avatars will at level 1 and they can evolve only after achieving enough missions. <br/> Depending on the level some accessories cannot be equipped (those with a more "richer" look), and some features are locked (Changing emotions only available for level 2).

- Verso : When you click on the avatar (and display the svg file), if you click on the avatar. It will display the "verso" which contains the name of the avatar, and some achievements of this avatar (badges).

- Animations : Have some fun and code some animations (blinking eyes, snow or rain falling, eyes pupill...). Probably need to hire another artist and collaborate with Arun.

- Accessories and lore : Using the the accessories (and especially the backgrounds) in a smart way to tell a story to people. <br/> We can combine that with level feature and only allow certain background once a specific level is reached.
