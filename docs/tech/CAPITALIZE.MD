# Capital vs small letters

## Accessory (canister)

A bad decision was made and the items have all been name with a capital letter at the beggining ("Cloth" / "Assassin-cap").

## Avatar (canister)

In the avatar all accessories (associated to their asset) are referenced with only small letters ("assassin-cap").

```
wearAccessory() <- expect small letters
removeAccessory() <- expect small letters
```
