### Properties

Each accessory is represented by a card. This card is stored as an NFT. If you are the owner of an accessory this is how it will be presented in your wallet.&#x20;

![Accessories card ](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 19.19.10.png>)

On each card you can see the 4 importants properties of an accessory.&#x20;

* **Rarity** : This score is an indication of how hard it will be to create this accessory, the more stars the more points this accessory will generate.&#x20;
* **Slot** : This is a visual indication to indicate in which slot this accessory will fill.&#x20;
* **Wear (value)** : This is a number between 0 and 100 that indicates the wearability of an accessory. Every day an accessory is equipped on your avatar it generated points but also decreases it's wear value by one. Eventually when the wear value reaches 0 the accessory will be automatically burned.
* **Season** : At the top of the card you can see the season this accessory was part off. Once a season is over, the accessories of this season will never be mintable again; but you will still be able to use them. Because accessories that are used will eventually burn this will make sure that some accessories will become increasingly rare as time goes on . **Imagine in 10 years meeting someone on the Internet equipped with one of the first accessories!**&#x20;

### **Materials**

To create accessories, you will need to collect materials. Materials are the raw ingredients  of our economy. Those collectibles can also be traded on a [marketplace](https://entrepot.app/marketplace/icpsquad2).&#x20;

Materials are also represented by cards but those are different from accessories.

![The most common material.](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 19.54.06.png>)

Each card contain the **supply value** of the corresponding material. This value represents the targeted proportion of the material supply.&#x20;

For instance : **wood** has a supply value of 24%. If 10 000 materials where released, the number of wood released would be 2400.&#x20;

_‚ö†Ô∏è This value is a target and that will be used as a reference target for airdrops and rewards. This means it his highly likely that at any point in time the targeted value doesn't match the value in the real economy. Every value will be available for each player to make the best decisions based on their objectives._

### Recipe

Each accessory can only be created by following a specific recipe. A recipe corresponds to a list of materials. Here is an example for the _**Shinobi suit.**_

![A recipe](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 20.02.12 (1).png>) ![Shinobi suit](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture d‚ÄôeÃÅcran 2022-06-07 aÃÄ 20.06.29.png>)

The recipe is directly related to the rarity of the accessories. The more rare the accessory, the more materials will be needed and also less commons materials will be required.

### Style score

Your avatar will daily generates a **style score** based on every accessory that is **equipped** on it.

The style score generated daily by an equipped accessory is equal to its number of stars.&#x20;

Assuming you have a 3-stars accessory equipped during a period of 10 days, you will generate in total during this period a style score of 3 x 10 = **30 points**.

Your style score is an essential metric for determining your rank in the **leaderboard** and the rewards that will be sent out to your character.&#x20;

### Burning

Every day an accessory is equipped it's wear value decreased by 1. When this value reaches 0 it will automatically get burned and removed from your character.

_‚ö†Ô∏è The action of equipping or removing an accessory also costs 1 point of wear value._
