## Getting started and deploying locally

Make sure you have :

- Dfx installed (>= 0.9.3).
- Node & npm.
- Vessel (Package manager for Motoko) : https://github.com/dfinity/vessel

Run the followings commands to start your replica, install dependencies and deploy the canisters :

```
dfx start --clean
npm install
vessel install
npm run local
```

If you want to upload assets into the canisters run :

```
npm run local:upload
```

## Interact using Node

During the deploy process, a local identity that you can use within node has been set up inside keys/keys.json. <br/>
This identity is automatically set up as admin for all the canisters (expect the ledger).

You can import this identity in any typescript file.

```
import { fetchIdentity } from "src/node/account";

let identity = fetchIdentity("admin");
console.log("My principal is : " + identity.getPrincipal().toString())
```
