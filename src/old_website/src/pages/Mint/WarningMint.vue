      1. You can only mint one avatar.
      <br />
      I know it sounds disappointing to try it out this avatar minter only once
      but it's the rule. 🛡

      2. You'll receive your avatar in your wallet a few minutes after the
      minting.
      <br />
      If you don't see it, try refreshing your wallet. If you still don't see
      it, contact us on Discord for assistance. ❓
