# 💫 Seasons

We want this game to be living and evolving. As life has cycles & seasons we think a living game should also integrate this concept.

That is why we will be launching multiple seasons with characters & accessories from atwork created by multiple artists, highlighting the creative talent from across the Internet Computer artist community!

Each season will also have his own story and a purpose.&#x20;

## Catch them all

Seasons also add an element of visual rarity, since all-new characters and accessories minted will only be for the artwork of the current season. Once a season is over, there will never be characters or accessories with that artwork generated again.

_This gives an unique opportunity for early adopters to collect accessories and a status symbol in a few years._

### Multiple characters across different seasons

We do want to reward veteran players who play the game and collect a character from each season. We also don’t want to penalise players if they're going to own artwork from a new season but don’t want to get rid of their previous character. In light of that, there will be a slight advantage given to players who collect a player during each season.\


When merging properties between characters of different seasons, the highest value for each property (including accessory boosted properties) are applied, plus an additional bonus:

* 2 different seasons = 5% boost
* 3 different seasons = 10% boost
* 4 different seasons = 15% boost
* 5 different seasons = 20% boost
* 6 different seasons = 25% boost
* 7 different seasons = 30% boost
* 8 different seasons = 35% boost
* 9 different seasons = 40% boost
* 10+ different seasons = 45% boost

### **Season 0**&#x20;

#### **Characters & accessories**

These first characters are made with love to be cherished by the early adopters who will make this project possible. We’ve chosen a human-based design with we hope will appeal to a broad audience of enthusiasts.

Arun caught our attention because he is already known for creating fantastic custom Avatars for a handful of the earliest DFINITY team members and community admins. Out of all the art concepts we collected for review, his work best captured our vision for the Season 0 characters and reflected his excitement for this project. You can find more art by Arun on his Instagram ([@\_arunarts](https://www.instagram.com/\_arunarts/)).

**Purpose**&#x20;

The Internet Computer is still an emergent technology. The community is also in its childhood : early names are taking on more responsibilities and bonds are being created .&#x20;

The main purpose of this season is to create a strong base for the community and test the concept of the game out there. We know that we won't get everything perfectly right from the beginning but we have chosen an experimental approach, as we believe this is where most of the lessons can be learned.&#x20;

On a technical side the season 0 will also match with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the game. &#x20;
