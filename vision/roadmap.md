# ðŸŒ± Roadmap

This is still a long way ahead, we will have to work hard to get there but eventually we would like to turn the game into an open internet service run by a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) using the SNS which will gamify & unify the entire Internet Computer ecosystem, and provide an incentive tool any project can use to drive engagement for their dApps.&#x20;

\
This means that eventually, ICP Squad NFT will become a collaborative digital art platform where projects can distribute branded virtual merchandise that has utility for their dApp. This will give developers the ability to quickly attract new users from the community.

For users, it simply means the Internet Computer will be a blockchain where anyone can easily start earning rewards just by using dApps built on it.
