# 🏆 Leaderboard

The gameplay is divided in **contests**, for each contest the scores of all the participants are set to 0 during the first day and then the goal is to cumulate the most points until the end of the contest. After the contest is over rewards are sent out based on your rank.

Each contest has a **start date**, **end date** and a **reward pool.**

### **Scores**

Your rank is the leaderboard is determined by your **total score.**&#x20;

Your total score is the sum of 2 different scores.

* **Style score**

This score is determined by the accessory you are wearing on your avatar for this period. This represents an approximation of how much **money** you have invested in the game.

Your style score during this period is calculated by the daily sum of all the stars of the accessories you are wearing.&#x20;

_👨‍🏫 For instance if the contest lasts for 30 days and you are wearing 2 accessories during this whole period. The first one being the **Helicap**  & the other one being the **Lab coat**._

_If you are wearing your two accessories without interruption during the 30 days you will generate 30 x (3 + 2) = 150 points._&#x20;

* **Engagement score**&#x20;

This score is determined by the **missions** you have completed during this period and the number of actions you have taken across multiple dApps. This represents an approximation of how much **time** you have invested in the game.&#x20;
