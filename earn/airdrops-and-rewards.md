# üéÅ Airdrops & rewards

Rewards are sent out monthly after the end of the contest for this month. The distribution is based on the ranks of each player, with a fair distribution curve and a bit of luck to make things funs. üçÄ

The rewards are sent out as materials.&#x20;

### **Materials**

Each material (expect **branded materials)** has a targeted value of the supply of total materials associated with it. You can read this value directly on the card.

This value ranges from 48% of the supply for the most common material (Cloth) to 1% of the supply for the most rare material (Dfinity-stone).

Every month the total value of materials that are airdropped will be determined according to the burn rate of our economy. If people are wearing out accessories, more rewards will be distributed.

Based on the **total number of materials** that needs to be airdopped, you will easily find the number of materials of each category that will be given out.&#x20;

_Let's stay the reward for this month is determined to be 10000 materials. In that scenario : 100 Dfinity-stone will be given away._ &#x20;

### _Partners NFTs_

Being part of the biggest community hub on the Internet Computer, we are regularly partnering with other projects on the IC, most of them like giving away NFTs. **Top ranked players will get more chance to win those limited airdrops.**&#x20;

Here are some of the projects we collaborated with in the past; more is to come.
