# ðŸ§  Neuron

### **Concepts**

If you are not familiar with the **Network Nervous System**. Please read this[ article ](https://www.dfinitycommunity.com/the-beginners-guide-to-the-network-nervous-system-nns/)first.

### Goals

* Take our part in the decentralisation of the **NNS** and increase engagement with governance process.
* Help develop governance tools and framework for a better management and accountable leaderships.
* Increased benefits for accessory holders and assured baseline of rewards.
* Increased stability for the game economy.

The **Motokans** neuron is locked with an 8-years delay and its stake is continually being increased trough different in-game mechanisms.&#x20;

### Funding&#x20;

The Neuron will be funded trough different mechanisms.

* **Accessory minting fee** (currently set at 0.5 ICP). All accessories fees are directly sent to the Neuron.
* **Legendary accessories sale :** 10% of the sale of legendary accessories is directly sent to the Neuron.

### Rewards

On a regular basis, the maturity from this Neuron is spawned and distributed to all active players who have an accessory equipped on their character.

The share of ICP given to each player is determined by their ranking over that applicable time period, which, like with normal rewards, is determined by their character properties and amount of activity on the Internet Computer (with twice as much weight given to activity). Unlike with normal rewards, itâ€™s not a random lottery.&#x20;

_**Every player who has a character wearing an accessory gets a non-zero share of the ICP Squad Neuron maturity.**_

This system will ensure an ongoing base of rewards for accessories holder, increasing the utility of accessories.

Since non-legendary accessories wear out over time, new accessories must be continually minted. Those minting fees will continue to grow the size of the ICP Squad Neuron.

This also mean that over enough time, whether the number of active players remains the same or grows significantly, the value of ICP sent to accessory holders will continue to increase along with the size of the ICP Squad Neuron.

### Governance&#x20;

We plan to use the governance power of that neuron to vote on proposals and make the voice of our community heard.&#x20;
