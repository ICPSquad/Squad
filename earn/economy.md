### Goals

#### **Low barrier to entry**&#x20;

Speculation and valuable prizes are fun, but it's not fair when games are too expensive for new players to join in. To get the best of both world that is why we have designed a dual NFT system.

Character NFTs give the wallet holder the ability to win rewards. Personalized characters can be minted on demand for flat rates, which keeps the floor price low for all new players so that the NFT game stays inclusive.

Accessory NFTs are both the rewards won by characters and the best way to customize a character to improve its odds of winning rewards. There are inflationary and deflationary mechanics to make sure accessories stay rare and valuable.

_After all, what‚Äôs an NFT game without a bit of speculation and collection fun?_

_Fair rewards favoring strategic and active players_

Earlier adopters and contributors, heavy Internet computer users, and heavily invested users deserve some advantage in our game. However, insiders, bots, and whales should never be able to hog rewards and ruin the fun for everyone else.

#### Long Term Market Stability <a href="#long-term-market-stability" id="long-term-market-stability"></a>

Most NFT projects are near-term pump and dump schemes with extremely volatile price swings. Our goal is to create a game with long-term market stability that‚Äôll grow to interact with as many Internet Computer apps as possible and act as a focal point for bringing the community together to support the entire ecosystem.

#### _Reward mechanisms_&#x20;

Rewards will be airdropped monthly based on player rank during the previous month.&#x20;

An easy way to think of this game is that it is basically like a massive ongoing daily raffle ticket prize pool between everyone who uses the IC and owns a character.

_T_he game needs to incentivise engagement and investment to make things worthwhile without giving bad actors the ability to ruin the fun by hogging rewards for themselves.&#x20;

To pull this off, we‚Äôll be using a lot of fancy math based on robust statistics, but in this guide, we‚Äôll aim to explain the basic approach in simple terms.

#### Lowest ranked player <a href="#lowest-ranked-player" id="lowest-ranked-player"></a>

To be eligible to win an accessory in a daily drawing, players will need to own at least (1) Level 1 character and perform at least one action during the previous 24 hours. The ‚Äú**Lowest Ranked Player**‚Äù would be the player that meets the bare minimum standard. They own a Level 1 Character with no accessories and perform only one action, so they are essentially given the worst odds of winning that day.

We are going to cap activity and boost advantages against this hypothetical ‚Äú**Lowest Ranked Player**.‚Äù

#### Max advantage cap <a href="#max-advantage-cap" id="max-advantage-cap"></a>

The top player can have up to a 200x chance of winning a reward over the lowest-ranked player by maxing out both the Action Cap and Boost Cap. While this may seem like a lot, it just means that no one can give themselves a higher chance of winning than the bottom 200 players on any given day.

We‚Äôll also be tweaking these thresholds over time with community feedback to find and maintain a balance that ensures fair yet engaging gameplay.&#x20;

Hopefully, these caps will mean that buying advantage is worth it but not enough to make things drastically unfair. Doing lots of activity is also worth it but not a guaranteed way to hog everything for yourself. We want a game full of surprises where anything can happen. Everyone is essentially playing the odds in a low-key environment with various amounts of speculation and risk that match their preference.

### **Accessories**

We are designing the economy to ensure that accessories will consistently stay rare & valuable.

For each slot we are targeting a percentage of the user population with equipped accessories on this slot.&#x20;

**Inflation :** is controlled by sending monthly rewards to players. Rewards are sent as materials but ultimately trough recipes those materials will turn out be accessories.&#x20;

**Deflation :** is controlled by making accessories slowly wear out over weeks. Once worn out, the accessory is burned. The one exception being legendary accessories that never wear out.

This is the **maximum** proportion that we are targeting for accessories.&#x20;

Eyes : Up to 30-40% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Head : Up to 20-30% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Face : Up to 10-20% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Body : Up to 10-20% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Misc : Up to 2-5% of avatar holders can fill this slot.

Recipes are designed to fill those targets. We will regularly assess our economy to see how we are positioning compared to those initial objectives.

### Statistics&#x20;

We will run regular audits of our internal economy and publish them.
